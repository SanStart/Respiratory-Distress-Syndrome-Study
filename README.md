# Respiratory-Distress-Syndrome-Study
This study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of lung ultrasound (LUS) versus chest X-ray (CXR) in diagnosing Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in neonates. The objective is to determine whether LUS can be a reliable alternative to CXR for early and accurate diagnosis, potentially reducing radiation exposure and improving clinical outcomes.
